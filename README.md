# Job Management Platform

This is a fully functional, user-friendly React application built for managing job postings, tracking candidates, and creating job-specific assessments. The platform streamlines the hiring process by allowing admins to post jobs, review candidate details, and assign tailored assessments for each position. This application is deployed on Netlify and accessible for a live demo.

## Features

### 1. **Dashboard for Managing Job Postings**
   - A comprehensive dashboard for the admin to view and manage job postings.
   - Each job listing displays:
     - Job title
     - Job description
     - Number of candidates applied
   - Admin capabilities:
     - **Add** new job postings
     - **Edit** existing job details
     - **Delete** job postings

### 2. **Candidate Tracking & Details Page**
   - View candidates who have applied for each job posting.
   - Candidate details include:
     - Name
     - Resume (upload/download)
     - Application date
     - Status (e.g., "Under Review", "Interview Scheduled")
   - Detailed candidate view provides:
     - Profile info (name, email, skills, experience)
     - Resume preview (or download option)
     - Status update option

### 3. **Job-Specific Assessment Creation**
   - Create unique assessments for each job.
   - Select a job from a dropdown and build multiple-choice questions for that job.
   - Manage questions and answers.
   - Each job has its distinct assessment, with no shared tests between jobs.

### 4. **User Interface & User Experience**
   - Responsive and intuitive design (optimized for desktop and mobile).
   - Clean, modular code adhering to React best practices.
   - State management using Redux or React Context API.
   - Consistent interface with Material-UI for user-friendly design.

### 5. **Routing & Data Handling**
   - React Router for smooth navigation between sections.
   - Data persistence via local storage or mock APIs.
